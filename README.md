## JMatrix

JMatrix is a lightweight java package that is designed for working with 2 dimensional matrices efficiently. It supports parallel computations for Numerical calculations like multiplications using the concept of multithreading to improve the running time.
The class supports all the classes that extend the Number class in java and it makes use of bounded generics to enforce type check during compile time.
